### Diagnosis:
Root Cause: {diagnosis.get('root_cause', 'Unknown')}
Suggested Fix Areas: {', '.join(diagnosis.get('suggested_fix_areas', []))}

### Code Context:
{code_context}

### Instructions:
1. Generate a unified diff patch that addresses the diagnosis.
2. Provide a clear and concise explanation of the changes.
3. Ensure the patch is syntactically valid.

Respond with the following format:
